Handbook for practice leads
===========================

A practice lead is a particular kind of leader in the organisation. 

The concern of practice leadership is the posture and behaviour of the organisation as a whole, in some field of practice that cuts across products, projects and teams. Insofar as it is associated with a particular outcome, it addresses that outcome through attention to the practices that affect it, and the people who must engage in the practice.

Canonical is pioneering a model of practice leadership in software as part of its wider ambitions for **engineering excellence**. The model needs to be systematic, pragmatic and adaptable - for example to domains beyond engineering. Above all, it needs to be effective. At the heart of that model is the person of the *practice lead* who is responsible for it.

The aim of this handbook is to help practice leads help Canonical towards its ambitions, by instituting and maintaining a way of doing things - a practice.

It will help practice leads set out their own picture of what their role is and what to do in it: part of the work of each practice lead is to define the practice, and therefore to define not just their own role too, but the idea of practice leadership itself. 

**Half of practice is theory**, and that's an important part of the work. The handbook also provides some practical guidance and reusable resources, to help navigate the challenges of this new role.

    introduction

Your project's early days
--------------------------

You need to communicate your project and its vision, in such a way that other people want to be part of them. You need people's faith in *you*, as a leader and you need them to work with you.
