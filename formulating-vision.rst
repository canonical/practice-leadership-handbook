====================
Formulating a vision
====================

The word *vision* is horribly overused. People have mundane ideas in everyday business conversations about distinctly ordinary work, and think they are having "visions". 

In the case of practice leadership, though, you really are going to have to be able to describe **a vision that deserves the name** - a new, transformative, coherent, encompassing picture of a discipline, that includes values, standards, ways of meeting and measuring them, and so on.

It's completely beyond the scope of this handbook to help you have a vision. You need to have one already. But if you're in the role of practice lead, it's because you were *already* able to describe a vision of practice in your domain, and enough people agreed that it was one the company should adopt. 

This section will help you formulate key components of it in ways that will stand up to scrutiny and the needs of communicating them with others.


An over-arching ambition
========================

Your description - the picture you paint - will need to include an over-arching ambition, that includes particular objectives, and an account of how you plan to reach them all.

What is your ultimate aim? Can you express it in a single sentence? 

..  admonition:: Example from documentation practice

    **To set a standard of excellence in documentation for the entire software industry**.

If your aim doesn't make people blink with surprise the first time they hear it, it probably isn't ambitious enough.


Excellence
----------

Your stated aim ought to embrace *excellence*. Otherwise, what's the point? 

And, you should make a point of referring to *excellence*, explicitly and by name, so that people get used to hearing about it.


Why does it matter?
-------------------

Depending on your domain, you may be lucky, and never need to explain *why* your aim is a valuable one for the organisation. Probably nobody will ask that question about security. A few might ask it about documentation. What about community practice, or energy efficiency?

You're going to need to have some good answers ready. They need to answer the question *why* from multiple perspectives, and be answers that you believe in.

Particular objectives
=====================

From your ambition, clear objectives should follow. The objectives you define are ones that can be *measured*. By describing them, you're taking a risk: you have publicly stated criteria on which your success can be judged.

There are three areas for which you need to have clear statements of what you intend to achieve:

* product: what we actually create - the tangible output of the practice
* people: how people will be affected or even transformed by your work - in their professional skills, their understanding of the domain, their career paths and options
* practice - the theory and execution of the craft

They all overlap. They are related aspects, not completely orthogonal dimensions, of your ambition. You might think of others, but these three need to be at the heart of your description.

..  admonition:: Example from documentation practice

    In documentation practice at Canonical, our key objectives are further divided into those with inward and outward perspectives:

    .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1
      :widths: 16 42 42  

      * - \
        - within
        - without
      * - product
        - our **internal documentation** delivers much more value; it's vastly better and more maintainable
        - our **product documentation** consistently excels in form, structure, scope, architecture, standards, value
      * - people
        - our **technical authors** embody professional insight, discipline and ambition
        - in our **open-source communities**, we have measurably raised documentation expectations, skills and participation
      * - practice
        - documentation **standards and approaches** serve as a model for practice leadership in other disciplines
        - **our way of doing documentation** is held up as an exemplar of good practice and emulated

In each case, the aim - to set a standard of excellence - is translated into statements, each of which we'll be able to ask: *is this true?* In each case, the statements suggest measurements, metrics or other objective conditions that we could identify in order to judge whether they have been met.

It's not the place to go into the finer details though. We don't set out *how* each of these will be judged, nor are they set in a time-frame. But, questions about that should follow naturally from them, and you will need at different times to have clear answers.

Getting there - your strategy
=============================

**How are we going to get to where you're proposing to take us?** This is where your ability to think strategically is needed. 

What are the *different* components of this strategy? How do they fit together?

..  admonition:: Example from documentation practice

    Four pillars of excellence:

    * **direction** - where we're going and how we know we're on the right track
    * **discipline** - a shared attitude, a culture of caring about it
    * **execution** - the right way of doing the things we do
    * **tooling** - the equipment that we'll be replying on

However you divide the strands of your strategy, they will represent lines where  you'll need to have good answers to questions about meeting your aims.
