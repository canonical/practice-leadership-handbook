Introduction
============

**You are an expert in your field, with a deep understanding of a technical practice**. You have an clear idea how it should be done, what excellence looks like, what an organisation needs to do to reach it, and what challenges will need to be overcome on the way. You're going to make these things clear to other people, too.

You might not yet *know* all these things yet, because it's quite possible that they are still to be discovered - but that is also one of the things that you are equipped to do, with your insight and ability to deal with new challenges, and respond effectively to situations and problems that you haven't yet encountered.

And you are just one person, with about 1200 colleagues (as of May 2024; the number continues to grow). Probably *not a single one of your colleagues* yet understands these things or how to do them (at least not in the way that you do). Worse, some of them might even be positively sceptical of the value of your expertise, knowledge and ideas.


Thinking
========

Half of your work is about *what and how other people think*. 

**You cannot possibly educate or change the minds of all those people all by yourself.** Instead, you will have to find other ways to promulgate your knowledge through the company. That will sometimes mean adopting methods less familiar to engineering leadership, such as ones used by successful politicians, or viruses. 

**Your ideas need to become the most attractive and memorable ones.** They need to displace others in people's minds: to be understood, valued, believed and expressed by them.


Doing
=====

The other half of your work is about *what people do and how they do it*.

**Sometimes people won't want to do what you need them to; sometimes they won't know how.** You'll have to find ways to address that, not as the difficult exception, but the expected default. Somehow, the way you want things to be done needs to become the most visible and obvious way. The habits you want to promote need to displace others.


Work that does itself
=====================

It should be abundantly clear that **you need other people to do this for you**. 

You need other people to spread your ideas and habits, so that they penetrate the organisation. The promulgation of your ideas and practices must - somehow - be built into those ideas and practices themselves. There must be something in them that means that even when you're not there, they are replicating themselves - because other people are repeating them, even when you're asleep.

A significant part of this handbook is about helping you to find ways to do that.


Reinforcement and maintenance
=============================

Change - establishing new practice - is one aspect of your challenge. Another is to maintain it, something that's especially hard to do as it scales. Somehow, all the plates have to be kept on spinning. The difficulty is that anything that requires inputs of energy has a tendency to wind down. You will not have the attention available to keep your eyes on everything, never mind the energy to intervene to maintain rigour and quality.

Your only chance of success is once again to **build reinforcement into the practices you establish**. They must become self-tightening mechanisms, that ratchet tighter and not looser in response to the inevitable testing and tugging that they will inevitably subjected to. They must draw attention to themselves,  signalling their own integrity and correctness, and flagging their own failures.

The numerous resources and tools presented in the handbook will help you do that, but you will need to find ways to adapt them to your own practice, and invent your owm.
