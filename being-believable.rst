..  rubric:: Substance and commitment

**You need people to believe in you**, just as much as you need them to believe in your vision. They need to believe in two things: your *substance*, and your *commitment*.


Substance
=========

The **substance** includes all those things you need behind your vision but might choose to keep out of its presentation: the evidence, the theoretical rigour, the reasoning, the battle-tested industrial experience. It also includes your own ability to put them all to work to meet your new challenge. 

If you have them, you'll be believable, and if not, you won't. You don't really need to do anything with them - they'll show up in what you say and do, and especially when you're pressed hard and need to fall back on them. People are remarkably good at recognising them, and probing for a lack of them when they sense that someone pretends to have more substance than they really do. 

**You do not need to prove your substance.** You are in this position, and that in itself tells people of it. If you lack substance, it's going to become apparent soon enough. It's not something you really need to worry about, or can do anything about if you don't have it.

Commitment
==========

Your **commitment** on the other hand *is* something that needs to be said out loud. **People need to hear you making commitments**, and they will notice if you don't.

*Commitments are promises that hold you hostage to the possibility of failure.* They make you vulnerable, which is why a genuine commitment is a powerful thing. With a commitment, you offer people the means to judge you.

Judgements and commitments need to be pronounced, in front of people. They must be made explicit - including the ones that seem obvious, or that you think are implied, or even that it feels slightly weird to say out loud - so make a point of making them, explicitly.

..  admonition:: Example from documentation practice

    I realised soon after starting at Canonical that many people who cared about documentation felt unheard on the subject. Worse, some of them expected me to be another person who would have ideas for them, but wasn't going to be a listener and wouldn't take account of their needs.

    I had to address that explicitly, so in my first opportunity to address a company-wide audience, I made some promises about this. I spoke about paying attention to needs and concerns, and being available to talk. I said: *If you're trying to make documentation better, whoever you are, I promise to be a perfect nuisance on your behalf.*

    Many people brought that up in the weeks and months that followed. It hit a nerve. There was an element of luck, but the words I chose expressed something people had been wanting to hear. 


Keeping promises
----------------

Of course, anyone can make fine-sounding promises - it doesn't mean they will be kept. Even worse is when someone manages to deceive themself, sincerely believing in a promise they won't maintain.

Your substance will evaporate with the first commitment you fail to keep. At the same time, unless you make promises that put you at risk, you are not offering anything of value in the first place.
