Building a team of practitioners
================================

..  rubric:: The people who matter

Without practitioners, there is no practice and you can't be a practice lead if nobody else is practising. If you don't have some already, you will need to find a way to create, nominate or invent a few; you'll almost certainly be required to be involved in hiring some.

There are two kinds of practitioners you need to consider: 

* **specialists**, whose work is centred in the practice; an example would be a technical author in documentation
* **non-specialists**, whose work is centred elsewhere but incorporate the practice in it; an example would be an engineer who leads their team's documentation efforts


Specialists
===========

You might find yourself working with an existing cohort of specialists - for example, techinical authors in documentation. Or you might need to build a team of specialists, from existing and new colleagues.

Either way, to be successful specialists need identity not only as a team, but also as a disciplinary group, professionals united by expertise and the values of their craft. They need:


Titles
------

This might seem an insignificant detail, but it's not. In an organisation where they are in a minority, or a novel introduction, a specialist's skills and understanding are often poorly understood. They can be undervalued, if the rest of the organisation has a weak grasp of why they are required.

They tend to acquire vague or even generic job titles, reflecting the uncertainty about what they do *even amongst the organisational leadership involved in creating those roles* - for example, "<Something> Specialist".

A name is part of an identity, and whatever names your specialists have should be pointed and sharp, and carry weight.


Clear role definitions
----------------------

Descriptions of what your specialists do must be clear. In particular, if there is a risk that their roles that are not so well understood, the description should be a formulation of the *value* that they bring through their work - not just a list of things they *do*.


Progress
--------

Even more important, these descriptions should not stand alone, but should be part of a framework of progression, in which one can read off how a specialist develops. The progression should show how the qualities of a specialist develop, and what value (for example) a Senior Specialist adds over a Junior Specialist.

The progression should go all the way. If other professions in the organisation have progressions through multiple levels, so should yours. Otherwise you send a signal that in that profession, progress will be limited.


Non-specialists
===============

In the case of non-specialists, you are working with people whose main identity is as something else. Their role in your practice is only a secondary duty. **They cannot do this effectively unless they dedicate less time and energy to their primary role**, and this will only find acceptance if you can show the value it creates.

You must find ways to give their role as your practitioner meaning, for them, in the team they belong to and in the organisation at large. That means developing ways to reflect:

* how much has to go in to their role - study, expertise, discipline, training
* the value they create - their contribution and impact

Both of these matter. Showing how serious the role is, and what sort of commitment it requires, will help you get agreement about *how much* you can ask of their time. But **showing value they create** is critical.

Recognition is the key. Especially at the beginning, it will do no harm at all to make a strong point of it, explicitly hightlighting the value and the person who created it at every opportunity. Many people in the organisation will not at first understand what the value is and why it matters, but having a leader in the organisation point it out will show that it does.

You will not have a career path or job definitions to offer these non-specialist practictioners. They already belong to their own discipline. But, you can define progress for them in a path that runs alongside that, marked by qualifications, achievements and other ways of recognising them.


Competing demands on practitioners
==================================

As the leader of a practice rather than a product or project, it is more likely that you will find yourself leading a team of practitioners who themselves are part of some product or project team (for example, a documentation author who is belongs to an engineering team).

There is immediately a tension here. These practitioners are in a position where there are competing demands on them. Their managers and colleagues in the other team may be concerned about the division of their duties. 

You will have to approach this with clarity, authority and empathy. How much of their time and commitment should be dedicated to your practice, and how much to their work in their other team? What will be the impact on that team?

There is scope here for real friction and even conflict, and you are going to have face it.
